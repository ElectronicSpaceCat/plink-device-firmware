# Driver for the VL53LX ToF Sensors

This driver has been modified to interface over i2c with the bluetooth module and will not work if using the original.

I used this driver for both the VL53L4CX and VL53L4CD in this project. There is an Ultra lite driver (ULD) for the VL53L4CD however I wanted more functionality that the VL53LX driver had.

The original can be found here:
